# Chuck Norris Joke Application

This is one of my first react/redux applications. To compile the source I used webpack.

### Todo:
* Check code comments
* Explain source code
* Write tests
* Add animations
* Create Github Pages Page (Basicly the content of the app folder)

## Instalation

* Clone this repo
* Run ```npm install``` from your local repo directory
* Run ```npm run build``` to compile the source

## Debuging / Viewing the app
For the local development I used browsersync, this has the added bonus that it also serves as a local server. To launch browsersync simply use the ```npm run watch``` command.


## Stuff I used to make this:

 * [Thinking in React](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/thinking-in-react.html) so I could get to know the core concept
 * [Using Redux with React](http://redux.js.org/docs/basics/UsageWithReact.htmlf) To understand Redux and how it works with React
 * [Persisting the state to localstorage](https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-redux-persisting-the-state-to-the-local-storage) A very easy way to implementing persistent favorites
